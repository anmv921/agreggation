# Diffusion-limited aggregation

This is a simulation of diffusion-limited aggregation.

A seed is at the center of a lattice and random walkers are released and are allowed to stick to it if they are at the adjacent cell.
A Brownian tree cluster with a fractal structure is the result of this process.
